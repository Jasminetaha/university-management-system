- Pandas

## Files Included
- `FINAL_UniversitySystemProject.py` – Main Python script containing all program functions
- `university_list.csv` – Sample data file used to store student and course information (must be in the same folder)

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (`python3 --version`)
2. Install Pandas if you haven't already:  
   `pip install pandas`
3. Place `FINAL_UniversitySystemProject.py` and `university_list.csv` in the same folder
4. Run the script:
